# Countdown

A faithful desktop recreation of the classic British TV game show **Countdown**, built with Python and PyQt5. Play the Numbers Game or the Letters Game from a polished launcher, complete with a 30-second countdown clock and an automatic computer solver that reveals the best possible answer after every round.

## Features

### Home Launcher (`main.py`)
- Full-screen animated home screen with background artwork
- Hover-animated game cards; each card launches its game in a separate process

### Numbers Game (`numbersgame.py`)
- Draw up to 4 **Big** numbers (25, 50, 75, 100) and **Small** numbers (1–10 × 2)
- A random 3-digit target (100–999) is generated once 6 numbers are drawn
- Build an arithmetic expression using `+  −  ×  ÷  ( )` by clicking tiles
- Undo individual steps or clear the entire expression at any time
- **Scoring:** 10 pts for exact, 7 pts within 5, 5 pts within 10, 0 pts otherwise
- **Stop the Clock** button for untimed practice
- Running score history (last 7 rounds) displayed in-game
- Post-round **Computer's Analysis** panel enumerates all solutions (or the closest reachable value) using recursive combinatorial search

### Letters Game (`lettersgame.py`)
- Draw up to 5 **Vowels** and 6 **Consonants** (frequency-weighted, authentic to the show)
- Build a word by clicking letter tiles; use **Undo** or **Clear All** to adjust
- 30-second countdown timer with optional **Stop the Clock**
- Word validated against a bundled dictionary (`words.txt`)
- **Scoring:** 18 pts for a 9-letter word, otherwise word length in points
- Post-round **Computer's Analysis** shows the longest possible word(s) from the drawn letters

4. Use **Undo** to remove the last token or **Clear All** to start over.
5. Click **SUBMIT SOLUTION** before time runs out.
6. The computer's analysis panel reveals all solutions after the round.

### Letters Game
1. Click **Draw VOWEL** or **Draw CONSONANT** until you have 9 letter tiles.
   - Maximum 5 vowels and 6 consonants (the rest are drawn automatically).
2. The 30-second clock starts once all 9 letters are drawn.
